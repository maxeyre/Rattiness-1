# A multivariate geostatistical framework for combining multiple indices of abundance for disease vectors and reservoirs: A case study of *rattiness* in urban Brazil

## Article
The manuscript has been submitted for publication. A link to a pre-print will be made available here soon.

## Data
A single .csv file can be found [here](). This contains the cleaned dataset for the cross-sectional survey for rat signs, traps and track plates in Pau da Lima community, Salvador, Brazil, which was collected between October and December 2014. It is georeferenced and includes all relevant covariate values used in the model described in the article. A codebook for variables can be found [here]().

## Software
The statistical software developed for this project and used for the *rattiness* analysis is divided into four separate scripts: 

- Full model
- Exploratory analysis - exploring covariate relationships and testing for residual spatial correlation
- Exploratory analysis - LRT tests
- 2 indices models
